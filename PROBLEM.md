## Objective

This exercise is created to get hands on with creating React forms and how to handle multiple form elements using formik

## To Do

- Fork the boilerplate
- Clone the forked repository to local system
- Open terminal in forked project location and run `npm i` command to install dependency
- Follow the instruction in each `.jsx` file in components folder to complete the assignment
- Use the Formik component to wrap your form and manage its state.
- Define form fields for name, email, password, and password confirmation.
- Implement validation using the Yup library. Define validation schemas for each field according to the rules mentioned above.
- Display error messages for each field if the validation fails.
- When the form is submitted, an alert box with the form values will be displayed
- Test your form by entering valid and invalid data.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT

Create a user registration form using Formik and Yup. The form should include fields for the user's name, email, password, and password confirmation. Implement validation rules to ensure the following:

- Name is required and must be at least 3 characters long.
- Email is required and must be a valid email address.
- Password is required and must be at least 6 characters long.
- Password confirmation must match the entered password.

Create a React application and use form handling mechanisms to achieve the above result
